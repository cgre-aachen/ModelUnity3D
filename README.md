# ModelUnity3D
very basic implementation of implicite modeling in unity, with the help of python.

The Unity project is contained in the `Project` folder, which is the one to be opened as a project in the Unity Editor.

In a running Unity scene, you should then see (choosing the Spawner object), buttons for spawning `Surface Point`s or `Orientation Point`s. Both can be assigned a Surface ID and a Series ID, which are necessary parameters for geomodeling.

The basic Interface in Unity looks like this (with an loaded model data from an example):
